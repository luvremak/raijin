RAIJIN – Vanilla JS Workout Tracker

RAIJIN is an all-frontend, browser-based workout tracker built with Vanilla JavaScript. It requires no backend or database — all your data stays in your browser using `localStorage`.

Features

- Log and track custom workouts
- Auto-calculate total workout volume
- Track most trained muscle group
- Workout history viewer
- Save and update user profile (with avatar preview)
- Add your own custom exercises
- Fully responsive, mobile-friendly layout

How It Works

- Exercises are grouped by muscle group (e.g., Chest, Back, Legs).
- Each workout entry includes reps, sets, and weight.
- Workout volume is calculated automatically as:  
  `sets × reps × weight`
- All data is stored locally using your browser’s `localStorage`.
