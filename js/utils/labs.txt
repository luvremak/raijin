Task 1:
1. Generator Function:

Write a generator function that produces an infinite stream of values. The values should be generated based on one of the following options:

Options for the Generator Function:
• Random Number Generator - Continuously yield random integers or floats.
• Round Robin Generator - Iterate over a given list (e.g., ["A", "B", "C"]) in a loop indefinitely.
• Fibonacci Sequence Generator - Yield the next number in the Fibonacci sequence endlessly.
 • Cyclic Date Generator - Cycle through the days of the week ("Monday" -> "Tuesday" -> ... -> "Sunday" -> "Monday" -> ...).
• Incremental Counter Generator - Yield an ever-increasing number starting from a given start value.
• Random String Generator - Yield random strings of fixed or random length.
• Color Cycle Generator - Continuously cycle through a predefined list of colors (e.g., "red" -> "green" -> "blue").

2. Timeout Iterator Function:

Write a function that accepts:
• An iterator (e.g., from the generator above)
• A timeout duration (in seconds)

It should continuously consume the iterator processing each value until the timeout has elapsed.

Ideas for the Processing Task:
• Print each value.
• If the iterator yields numbers and prints the total/avg on each iteration
• For colours, print the current date and iteration in a specified colour
